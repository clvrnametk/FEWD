Prompt
"What temperature scale would you like to convert that temperature to? Enter \"F to C\" or \"C to F\""
  tempConvert


1
If a user selects C to F then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Celsius,
and should therefore be converted to the Fahrenheit temperature.
  tempConvert == "C to F"
  "tempNum &deg;F is" + (((tempNum * 9) / 5) + 32) + "&deg;C"

2
else If a user selects F to C then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Fahrenheit,
and should therefore be converted to the Celsius temperature.
  tempConvert == "F to C"
  "tempNum &deg;C is" + (((tempNum - 32) * 5) / 9) + "&deg;F"

3
else
  tempConvert != "F to C" ||
  tempConvert != "C to F"
  "Please make sure to enter either \"F to C\" or \"C to F\", refresh and try again please."
